    "\n",
    "Denne Scrapy crawler fungerer som en automatiseret web-scraper der systematisk gennemgår EU's klimanyhedsside. Lad mig forklare hvordan den virker:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hvordan crawleren kører automatisk\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Start og initialisering\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "start_urls = ['https://climate.ec.europa.eu/news-your-voice/news_en']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Crawleren starter med én URL og begynder automatisk at processere den gennem parse()-metoden.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Automatisk paginering\n",
    "\n",
    "Crawleren fortsætter automatisk til næste side gennem denne logik:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "next_page_url = urljoin(self.main_url, soup.find(\"a\", attrs = {'aria-label': \"Go to next page\"})['href'])\n",
    "\n",
    "if next_page_url is not None:\n",
    "    yield scrapy.Request(url = next_page_url, callback=self.parse)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* På hver side søger den efter *\"Go to next page\"* linket\n",
    "* Hvis linket findes, opretter den automatisk en ny request til næste side\n",
    "* `yield scrapy.Request()` fortæller Scrapy at fortsætte med at kalde `parse()` på den nye URL\n",
    "* Dette skaber en rekursiv `loop` der fortsætter gennem alle sider\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crawleren stopper automatisk når én af disse betingelser er opfyldt:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ikke flere sider (primær stop-betingelse)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    next_page_url = urljoin(self.main_url, soup.find(\"a\", attrs = {'aria-label': \"Go to next page\"})['href'])\n",

    "if next_page_url is not None:  # Hvis None, yields den ikke mere\n",
    "    yield scrapy.Request(url = next_page_url, callback=self.parse)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Når der ikke findes flere \"næste side\" links, sættes next_page_url til None, og crawleren stopper naturligt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fejl eller exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hvis der opstår kritiske fejl (netværksfejl, server nedlukning, etc.), vil Scrapy stoppe crawleren.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manual stop**\n",

    "\n",
    "API'er (til databaser) er meget forskellige, men indeholder typisk de samme følgende grundkomponenter:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Request:** Ligesom al anden kommunikation med internettet, involverer brug af API at sende en *request* (GET eller POST) til en server. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Endpoint:** API'er indeholder typisk flere forskellige *endpoints*. Tænk på disse som \"haner\", man kan koble sig på, for at udtrække data. Endpoints er URL'er, som en request skal sendes til.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:** Parametre er de argumenter eller indstillinger, som endpoint accepterer eller forventer. Nogle er krævet for overhovedet at få data tilbage, andre er valgfrie.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authentication:** De fleste API'er kræver en eller anden form for autentificering. Man ser typisk to former for autentificering: HTTPS autentificering (brugernavn og adgangskode) og autentificering via \"tokens\". Tokens er unikke \"nøgler\" - en samling af tekst, tegn og tal, som for serveren unikt identificerer, hvem der sender henvendelsen."
